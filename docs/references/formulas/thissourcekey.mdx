The THIS_SOURCE_KEY function is used in the secondary KPIs when the node is data source node. 
Based on the source key, the function returns the value of the row from the data series. 

## Syntax

DS.(SERIES).THIS_SOURCE_KEY

## Example
Consider a scenario where you have a node called 'East_Industrials'. The baseline and comparison series 
are sales actuals and budget and the third series Salespersons is the number of salespersons associated. You want to
display the number of salespersons as a secondary KPI.

This can be achieved by using SUM(DS.Salespersons.THIS_SOURCE_KEY).

This function matches the source key 'East_Industrials' in the series Salespersons and displays the  
corresponding value.
