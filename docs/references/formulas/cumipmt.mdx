The `CUMIPMT` function returns the cumulative interest paid between two periods.

## Syntax
```javascript
CUMIPMT (Rate, Nper, PV, start_period, end_period, Type)
```
## Arguments
`Rate` – The interest rate per period. 

`Nper` – The total number of periods.

`PV` – The present value of the loan. 

`start_period` – The first payment period. 

`end_period` –  The last payment period.

`Type` – Indicates when the payments are made. Type is zero if payments are made at the end of the period and non-zero if payments are made at the start of the period. 

## Example
Consider a $10,000 loan at an annual rate of 10% that is to be paid off in 3 years. All payments are made at the beginning of the month.

To calculate the interest payment for a specified range of periods, say between period 12 and 18, the formula should be
```javascript
CUMIPMT (Rate/12, Number of Years*12, Loan Amount, 12, 18, 0)
```
The cumulative interest payments between 12th and 18th months is calculated to be $376.67.
