## Example
Consider a scenario where you want to calculate the contribution of a particular region, say South to the Total sales.

| Region | Sales in Millions |
|--------|-------------------|
| East   | 200               |
| West   | 300               |
| South  | 250               |
| Total  | 750               |

To achieve this, the formula should be 
```javascript
(Sum(THIS)/Sum(ForEach(THIS.PARENT.CHILDREN, THIS) ) )) * 100
```
The contribution of South to Total Sales is calculated to be 33.33%.
