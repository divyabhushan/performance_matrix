The `RATE` function returns the interest rate per period of a loan or an investment.

## Syntax
```javascript
RATE (Nper, PMT, PV, [FV], [Type], [Guess])
```
## Arguments
`Nper` – The total number of periods.

`PMT` – The payment made each period.

`PV` – The present value - the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now. 

`FV` – The future value or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. This is an optional argument.

`Type` – Indicates when the payments are made. Type is zero if payments are made at the end of the period and non-zero if payments are made at the start of the period. 

`Guess` – Estimate of what the rate will be. This is an optional argument.

## Example
Consider a series of $2000 payments made at the end of each year for 6 years. The objective is to calculate the interest rate where the present value is $10,000.  

To calculate the present value, the formula should be 
```javascript
RATE (Number of Periods, PMT, Present Value,0)
```
The interest rate is calculated to be 5.47%.
