---
The `IRR` function returns the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows. Node references also accepted as arguments.

## Syntax
```javascript
IRR (value1,[value2],…, [Guess])
```
## Arguments
`value1` – The node that contains the order of cash flows for which you want to calculate the internal rate of return.

`value2,…`  – The additional nodes that contains the order of cash flows for which you want to calculate the internal rate of return. This is an optional argument.

`Guess` – A value that you guess is close to the actual IRR value. This is an optional argument.

## Example
Consider a project with an initial investment of $10,000 and cash inflows of $4,000 for the subsequent four years. The objective is to evaluate the project by calculating IRR. 

| Period             | 0       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|--------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Initial Investment | -10,000 |       |       |       |       |
| Cash Inflows       |         | 4,000 | 4,000 | 4,000 | 4,000 |

To achieve this, the formula should be
```javascript
IRR ([Initial Investment,Cash Inflows.ALL_PERIODS])
```
`IRR` is calculated to be 14.76%
