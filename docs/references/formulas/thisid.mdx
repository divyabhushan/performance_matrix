The THIS_ID function returns the value of the row with node id as source key.

## Syntax

DS.(SERIES).THIS_ID

## Example
Consider a scenario where you want to assign a node's value and the node ID matches the source key.

This can be achieved by using SUM(DS.(SERIES).THIS_ID).

This is especially useful when you want to use data from the additional series.
