## Syntax

```javascript
CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX < 5 ? value1 : value2;
```

`CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX` points to the current period of the node for which vaule is getting calculatd.

## Example

Assume we have modelled a profit and loss statement using ValQ and we want to show the YoY growth in profits. This can be achieved by the following formula

```javascript
(THIS.GET(CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX)/THIS.GET(CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX-1))\*100
```

Letâ€™s consider another example. To assign values to a node based on the period index, say for the 1st period the value is N1*2, 2nd period N1*3, 3rd period N1\*4, the formula will be

```javascript
SWITCH(CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX, 1, N1 * 2, 2, N1 * 3, 3, N1N1\ * 4);
```
