title: AVERAGEEXZERO
---
The `AVERAGEEXZERO` function returns the average (arithmetic mean) of its arguments excluding zeros, which can be numbers or node references.

## Syntax
```javascript
AVERAGEEXZERO (value1,[value2]....)
```
## Arguments
`value1` – The first node or number to be averaged. This is a required argument.

`value2, …`  – The additional nodes or numbers to be averaged. These are optional arguments.

## Example
Consider sales of a particular product across different regions East, South, Central and West to be as follows. 
Assume if sales for a particular period is zero, the product was withdrawn from the market and hence that region need not be considered when calculating average sales.  
The average sales is also shown in the table. 

| Region        | Jan | Feb | Mar   | Apr    | May    | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep    | Oct | Nov   | Dec |
|---------------|-----|-----|-------|--------|--------|-----|-----|-----|--------|-----|-------|-----|
| East          | 100 | 100 | 125   | 150    | 100    | 100 | 120 | 125 | 0      | 0   | 0     | 0   |
| South         | 0   | 0   | 150   | 200    | 200    | 175 | 175 | 150 | 150    | 125 | 125   | 175 |
| Central       | 100 | 100 | 125   | 150    | 100    | 0   | 0   | 0   | 150    | 200 | 200   | 175 |
| West          | 0   | 0   | 150   | 125    | 125    | 175 | 200 | 175 | 175    | 125 | 0     | 0   |
| Average Sales | 100 | 100 | 137.5 | 156.25 | 131.25 | 150 | 165 | 150 | 156.33 | 150 | 162.5 | 175 |

The average sales should be defined as 
```javascript
AVERAGEEXZERO (East, South, Central, West).
```
