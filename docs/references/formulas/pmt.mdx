The `PMT` function calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.

## Syntax
```javascript
PMT (Rate, Nper, PV, [FV], [Type])
```
## Arguments
`Rate` – The interest rate per period. 

`Nper` – The total number of periods.

`PV`  –  The present value or initial investment. Cash outflows are considered as negative and cash inflows as positive.

`FV` – The future or residual value. This is an optional argument and if omitted, it is considered to be zero.

`Type` – Indicates when the payments are made. Type is zero if payments are made at the end of the period and non-zero if payments are made at the start of the period. This is an optional argument and when omitted, it is considered to be zero.

## Example
Consider a $10,000 loan at an annual rate of 10% that is to be paid off in 3 years. All payments are made at the beginning of the month.

To calculate the monthly payments that are to be made, the formula should be 
```javascript
PMT (Rate/12, Number of Years*12, Loan Amount, 0, 1)
```
`PMT` is calculated to be $320.01.
