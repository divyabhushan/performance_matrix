The `NPV` function returns the net present value of an investment based on a discount rate and a series of future payments (negative values) and income (positive values).

## Syntax
```javascript
NPV (Rate, value1, [value2], ...)
```
## Arguments
`Rate` – The rate of discount.

`value1` – The node that contains the order of cash flows for which you want to calculate the net present value.

`value2,…`  – The additional nodes that contains the order of cash flows for which you want to calculate the net present value. This is an optional argument.

## Example
Consider a project with an initial investment of $10,000 and cash inflows of $4,000 for the subsequent four years. Discount rate is 12%. The objective is to evaluate the project by calculating NPV. 

| Period             | 0       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|--------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Initial Investment | -10,000 |       |       |       |       |
| Cash Inflows       |         | 4,000 | 4,000 | 4,000 | 4,000 |

To achieve this, the formula should be 
```javascript
NPV ([Discount Rate,Cash Inflows.ALL_PERIODS]) + Initial Investment
```
NPV is calculated to be $847.68.
