The `FV` function returns the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

## Syntax
```javascript
FV (Rate, Nper, [Pmt], PV, [Type])
```
## Arguments
`Rate` – The interest rate per period. 

`Nper` – The total number of periods.

`Pmt` – Equal payments paid out each period during the course of the investment term. This is an optional argument.

`PV`  –  The present value or initial investment. Cash outflows are considered as negative and cash inflows as positive.

`Type` – Indicates when the payments are made. Type is zero if payments are made at the end of the period and non-zero if payments are made at the start of the period. This is an optional argument and when omitted, it is considered to be zero.

## Example
Consider a series of $2000 payments made at the end of each year for 6 years. The objective is to calculate the future value at the end of 6 years where the interest rate is 5%.  

To calculate the future value, the formula should be 
```javascript
FV (Interest Rate, Number of Periods, PMT,0,0)
```
The future value is calculated to be $13,603.83.
